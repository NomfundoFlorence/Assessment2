Scenario

There is an upcoming carnival show in a certain area. People are registering to audition for the carnival,
for different types of activities. These activities include Dancing, singing, Drawing, Sculpting, Drama and Poetry.
The participants have an option of auditioning/performing solo or with a group of people. They register at a center
nearby and wait for an SMS confirming the date they should avail themselves for auditions.

Functionality

The web platform I created will allow the participants to register themselves for the auditions by first proving
their personal details and the choice of activity they wish to do at the carnival. As soon as they have entered their
details, they will be stored in a database after they press the “Apply for auditions” button. That will then lead
them to a page where they will be given an option to add a participant as part of their audition or remove a
participant only if they can provide their full details. If no participant will be added or deleted, they can select the
“no” option. When the “yes” option is selected, a section where they can add the details of another participant will
appear. After that process they will then proceed to the last page which will state their application status after
they set a possible date, they are willing to avail themselves and have phone number which they can contact should they
have any queries.
